YOURLS stands for Your Own URL Shortener.

It is a small set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run your own
URL shortening service (a la TinyURL or bitly).

Running your own URL shortener is fun, geeky and useful: you own your
data and don't depend on third party services. It's also a great way
to add branding to your short URLs, instead of using the same public
URL shortener everyone uses.
